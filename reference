Long-tail methods:

[1] Decoupling Representation and Classifier for Long-Tailed Recognition (Train a weighted balanced classifier)
[2] Unbiased scene graph generation from biased training (Longtail debias under the guidance of causal reasoning)
[3] Learning deep features for discriminative localization (CAM technology)
[4] Long-Tailed Classification by Keeping the Good and Removing the Bad Momentum Causal Effect (Longtail debias under the guidance of causal reasoning)
[5] Learning From Multiple Experts: Self-paced Knowledge Distillation for Long-tailed Classification (Use expert model trained by multiple subsets to guide student model)
[6] Remix: Rebalanced Mixup (Mixup augmentation method for longtail)



Transfer learning:

[1] Feature transfer learning for deep face recognition with under-represented data (Use Gan to generate more tail data)
[2] Soundnet: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video (Transfer knowledge from one modal to another)
[3] Feature space augmentation for long-tailed data (Tail classes features augmentation by CAM decomposition)
[4] Deep representation learning on long-tailed data: A learnable embedding augmentation perspective (Tail classes features augmentation by creating feature cloud)
[5] Large Scale Fine-Grained Categorization and Domain-Specific Transfer Learning (Transfer knowledge by fine-tune stratege)



Data:

[1] Vggsound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset (VGGsound, Audio recognition data set with multi-modal data)
[2] Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database （Imagenet,an image dataset which we may transfer knowledge from）
