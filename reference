Long-tail methods:

[1] Feature space augmentation for long-tailed data (Tail classes features enhance by CAM decomposition)
[2] Deep representation learning on long-tailed data: A learnable embedding augmentation perspective
[3] Learning deep features for discriminative localization



Data:

[1] Vggsound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset (VGGsound, Audio recognition data set with multi-modal data)
[2] Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database （Imagenet,an image dataset which we may transfer knowledge from）



Transfer learning:

[1] Feature transfer learning for deep face recognition with under-represented data
[2] Soundnet: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video ()
