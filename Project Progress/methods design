#Methods design


In face of longtail tasks, we usually meet two challenges: 
1. lack of tail samples to learn a well-represented feature, which makes the model hard to recognize the tail class.  
2. hard to learn a solid border line between the tail class and nearby classes in feature space, 
which makes it difficult to distinguish the tail class and similar classes.  

In fact, normal data augmentation for tail classes is an optional way to solve the first challenge but fail to deal with the later one,
because these augumented samples are quite similar and can't fill up the feature space evenly.  

optional methods:

1. use feature-level augmentation by learn the general part from the well-represented classes.  
2. use knowledge in a different modal to guide current tail classes.
