# Long_tail-debias-by-transfering-cross-modal-feature

The long-tailed distribution exists widely in the natural distribution, while few people notice the different distributions between different modals even in corresponding scene.
Imagine the scene: Some people gather around a table and are having a meeting, and we recoerd vision and audio data respectively. In the vision modal we see tables, people, chairs mostly, while in audio modal we hear people talking, device ringing, clapings mostly. In fact, the data of these two modes do not correspond well in distribution.


## We focus on the following questions:

1. Find the difference in data distribution of different modalities in the corresponding scene;  
2. Enhencing tail under-represented classes utilizing well-represented classes in another;  
3. Effective knowledge transfer between different modalities and different categories.
