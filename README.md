# Long_tail-debias-by-transfering-cross-modal-feature

The long-tailed distribution exists widely in the natural distribution, but few people notice the different distributions among different modals even in corresponding scene.



## We focus on the following questions:

Find the difference in data distribution of different modalities in the corresponding scene;
Enhencing tail under-represented classes utilizing well-represented classes in another;
Effective knowledge transfer between different modalities and different categories.
